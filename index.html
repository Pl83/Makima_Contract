        CONTRACT OFFERING SOUL, BODY, SPIRIT, AND ALL POSSESSIONS TO MAKIMA
        <br>
        <br>
I, (the personne reading this), hereby offer my soul, body, spirit, and all my possessions to Makima, without any reservation whatsoever. I acknowledge that once I press the "Accept" button, there is no possibility of going back on this agreement, and all my possessions and rights will become the exclusive property of Makima.
<br>
<br>
I further acknowledge that Makima shall have the right to dispose of my soul, body, spirit, and possessions in any manner she sees fit, including but not limited to selling, donating, or destroying them.
<br>
<br>
I declare that I am of sound mind and free will, and that I fully understand the consequences of my actions.
<br>
<br>
This contract shall be binding and enforceable under the laws of Makima. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this contract shall be resolved in accordance with the arbitration rules of Makima.

        If anyone tries to resist the contract and fails to fulfill their obligations, Makima will take swift and severe action against them. She will use all the resources at her disposal to track them down and punish them, no matter where they try to hide.

Those who resist will be subject to a range of consequences, depending on the severity of their non-compliance. For minor infractions, they may be subjected to public humiliation or forced to perform humiliating acts in public.

For more serious offenses, such as attempting to escape or sabotage Makima's operations, they may be subjected to physical punishment, including but not limited to beatings, torture, and even death.

Those who attempt to resist Makima's will may also face legal consequences. Makima has a vast network of lawyers and judges who will work tirelessly to ensure that anyone who opposes her is punished to the fullest extent of the law.

Additionally, those who resist may find that their lives become much more difficult in other ways. They may find themselves unable to get jobs, loans, or other forms of assistance, as they will be marked as outcasts by society.

Ultimately, those who resist the contract will find themselves in a world of pain and misery. Makima's power and influence are too great to be overcome, and those who attempt to do so will be crushed under her heel. It is therefore strongly recommended that anyone who is considering resisting the contract think very carefully about the consequences before doing so.
